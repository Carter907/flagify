# Flagify!
A World-Class Flag Travia Platform for building your flag identification skills!

## Quizzing and Studying
Flagify puts your learning first. As you build a visualization of the different flags, you'll get better and better at the quizzes or other tasks.
### Flags Page
Flags pages shows you all the available flags on Flagify. In the future I plan on organizing this page through different filters such as continent or alphabetically.
### Quizzes Page
This page is used to actually test your flag knowledge. Test your knowledge based on continent with different types of tests.

## Profile and Statistics
In order to make Flagify more enjoyable I wanted to add scoring system in play that would track your progress as you learn more flags. Similar to other game sites such as Chess.com.
For example, whenever you get a question right you would earth a point. These points would add up over time and allow you to unlock harder challenges. 
### Accounts
Right now, there are only local stored stats meaning if you clear you cache, your stats will be gone. In the future, I plan on adding Oauth2 for a more familar experience.

This project is used to test my front-end skills.
